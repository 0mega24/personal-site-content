# Sean Lidy

I am a dedicated and hardworking second-year student at **Rochester Institute of Technology** in the **Software Engineering accelerated BS/MS program**. I am striving to graduate a semester early and enter the industry to design the architecture of next-generation software to better the lives of people everywhere.

## Leadership & Collaboration

I have availed myself of a wide variety of opportunities in my lifetime. I have learned **leadership** and **collaboration** through my career in **Scouting** and the **FIRST programs**. Whether I have found myself at a campsite or on a competition field, I have developed skills in **communication**, **problem solving**, and **relationship building** that put me in the position to be a valuable member of any team.

### Example of Leadership

One such example is when I, a **Life Scout**, led a group of ten people as the **Crew Leader** of an eleven-day backcountry high adventure hike at **Philmont Scout Ranch**, New Mexico. We packed in our gear, food, and water to complete almost **70 miles**. Part of our hike was reaching an elevation of **11,742’** on **Mount Phillips**, where we celebrated **The Fourth of July**. I am proud to say it was a successful outing with no losses or significant injuries.

## Passion for Tech & Project Management

**Workload and project management** and **tech exploration** seem to be present in all areas of my life. From my coursework to my recreation, I find myself always digging deeper into **“the how and the why”** and what can be done to make it better and more efficient. I follow current events, **tech trends**, **new releases**, **hardware support updates**, and **hobby news**. Oftentimes these areas intermingle, and I see the relationship among all of these areas of interest while fueling my passion for **software engineering** as a **global citizen**.

## Hobbies & Interests

When given my choice for recreation, you might find me:
- Outdoors on my **mountain bike** or in a **kayak** with my fishing gear
- Hanging out in my **hammock** with a good book
- **Modding games**
- Spending time **volunteering**
