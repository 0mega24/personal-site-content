# About Me

Do you call it lucky or blessed to have been a part of a wide variety of opportunities in my lifetime?

## My Family Legacy

How many people can say their grandfather was a pioneer with IBM, installing one of the first computer in the Midwest at Standard Oil? Or that their grandmother tried to use Ubuntu? How about having a first cousin once removed who helped to develop object-oriented programming (Smalltalk)?

Perhaps the universe has positioned me for experiences to make me an impactful Software Engineer.

## Leadership and Collaboration

The opportunities in Scouting found me serving the Troop and community through leadership roles where I managed groups, organized events, and served as liaison between the boys and adults. My involvement in FIRST youth robotics definitely provided repeated scenarios to forge alliances, to quickly remedy unexpected challenges, and clearly share information with a wide audience. These skills have 

I have learned leadership and collaboration through my career in **Scouting** and the **FIRST** youth robotics programs. Whether I have found myself at a campsite or on a competition field, I have developed skills in:

- Communication
- Problem solving
- Relationship building

These skills have put me in the position to be a valuable member of any team.

## Building Connections

Opportunities are found in the every day of life, too, like becoming part of a historical academic fraternity at RIT.  The Computer Science House has an almost 50 year history with alumni all over the world.
The connections and friendships with others in the tech world gives perspectives and food for thought.
CSH creates learning opportunities, teaching opportunities, and memories.  It's given me the chance to camp at Brandreth Park, dine on top of the City of Rochester, and develop lasting friendships.

## Passion for Tech and Exploration

Workload, project management, and tech exploration seem to be present in all areas of my life. From my coursework to my recreation, I find myself always digging deeper into:

- **"The how and the why"**
- What can be done to make it better and more efficient?

I follow:

- Hardware releases
- JavaScript Updates and Frameworks
- Software modding
- Game Development
- Linux software support

Oftentimes these areas intermingle, and I see the relationship among them while fueling my passion for software engineering as a **global citizen**.

### Recent Interests

Recently, I had the opportunity to take a deep dive into **AI and American Politics**. If you need a recommendation for a good book, may I suggest **Life 3.0** by Max Tegmark or **Supremacy AI** by Parmy Olson?

## My Recreation

When given my choice for recreation, you might find me:

- Outdoors on my **mountain bike**
- In a **kayak** with my fishing gear
- Hanging out in my **hammock** with a good book
- Modding **games**
- Spending time **volunteering**

There isnâ€™t anything much better than fresh fish over a **campfire** and sleeping under the stars!

## Looking Ahead

Where is my next opportunity-of-a-lifetime? I hope to see you there!
